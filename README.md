# Smart Doorbell System
A summary of IOT architecture and protocol of a Smart Doorbell System using Latex . 

The "Smart Doorbell System" is a project that aims to create a doorbell system that can recognize visitors and take specific actions based on their identities. The system uses a Raspberry Pi, a camera, and a neural network to detect and recognize faces. When a visitor presses the doorbell button, the camera takes a picture and sends it to the neural network for processing. The network then compares the picture to a database of known individuals and, if a match is found, sends a notification to the homeowner with the visitor's name and image. The homeowner can then use a web interface to view the visitor's image and choose to open the door remotely or leave it locked. Additionally, the system also has the ability to store past visitors and their timestamps for security purpose.
