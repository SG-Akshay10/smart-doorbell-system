    \section{Summary}
    A smart doorbell system is a device that is installed on the exterior of a home or building and allows the user to monitor and interact with visitors remotely. The system typically includes a camera, speaker, and microphone, as well as a connection to the internet. When a visitor rings the doorbell, the camera gets triggered and captures their face and it checks for their face with the database which already has registered faces, when an unauthorized person is detected, it alerts the user through a text message. This allows the user to monitor the front of their home or building even when they are not at home. Overall, a smart doorbell system provides a convenient way for homeowners and building managers to monitor and interact with visitors remotely and provides added security benefits.
\section{Design And Work Process}
\begin{multicols}{1}    
    \begin{enumerate}    
        \item Design concept: \\
        The paper presents an intelligent doorbell system that utilizes human face identification as the primary method of operation. The system employs face detection and subsequently compares the detected face to entries in a database 
        to identify the individual. The system is demonstrated with an example in Figure 1.

        \makebox[8cm][r]{Fig 2 : Flowchart of system procedures}\\
        \item Face Detection: \\
        This section of the paper discusses the process of resolving images to determine whether human faces appear and pinpoint their location for cropping, using Haar-like features and looping through the image to identify and locate faces for cropping. Filters such as face alignment and scaling are applied to improve the algorithm's effectiveness.
        \item Feature Extraction: \\
        This section discusses the process of extracting human-face patches from images after detection. Feature extractions are implemented to reduce dimension, improve conspicuous extraction, and decrease noise. The face image is transformed into a fixed-dimension vector and stored in an XML or PCD file. The faces are described as polygons or objects.
        \item Feature Recognition: \\
        This section describes the process of applying a matching algorithm between the stored data and the input image.Two main applications are established: identification and verification. Identification allows the system to recognize the person through a given face image using the Eigenface algorithm. Verification, on the other hand, differentiates if a given face image matches or not with a guess face to improve the verification. The steps of face recognition are illustrated in Figure 2.

    \section{IOT Architecture}
    This paper aims to discuss the development of an enhanced smart doorbell system based on face recognition technology and IoT (Internet of Things) device. The system utilizes biometrics to map facial features from a photograph or video and compares the information with a database of known faces to find a match. The main goal of this work is to form an intelligent doorbell system based on human face identification, in order to enhance security and improve home automation.\\ 

    The system utilizes the OpenCV library and replaces costly image processing boards by using a \textbf{Raspberry pi board} with ARMv7 Cortex-A7 as the core.e face recognition process is initiated by pressing the doorbell button, where an \textbf{integrated camera} integrated camera captures several pictures of the visitor. The recently scanned face is then verified in the present database. In case of an unknown face, the {principal component analysis (PCA), the \textbf{GSM Module}, an IoT device that is connected to the internet and can send notifications to the owner's mobile phone is programmed and implemented on the platform.\\
